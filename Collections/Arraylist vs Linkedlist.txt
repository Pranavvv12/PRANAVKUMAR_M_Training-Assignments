Internal implementation :

ArrayList
Backed by a dynamic array.
Elements are stored in contiguous memory.

LinkedList
Implemented as a doubly linked list.
Each node stores data + previous + next reference.

Use ArrayList when:
You need fast random access by index (lots of get(i) / set(i)).
Most operations are traversal + append at the end.
You don’t do many insertions/deletions in the middle or beginning.

Use LinkedList when:
You frequently insert/delete at the beginning or in the middle.
You are often working with iterators and inserting/removing via them.
You don’t need fast random access by index.
